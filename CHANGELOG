---- Changes since 2.3 ----
Old rotated log files are included in AWstats reports as well.
---- Changes since 2.4 ----
Added Apache script alias for /awstats so that the URL /awstats/awstats.pl works.
Either awstats.conf or awstats.model.conf are supported as template config files.
---- Changes since 2.5 ----
Log files with % in their names are no longer checked for existance, as AWstats replaces these with dates/times.
